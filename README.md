# ZOE
### An assistant that everybody needs!

</br>

## COMMANDS 

###  Here are the current commands you can use for Zoe:

- **Zoe, wake up** - as the name of the command suggests, it wakes up Zoe from sleep.
- **Zoe?** and **Zoe, are you there?** - You can use these ones to check if Zoe is listening to you!
- **Zoe, say hello** - makes the Zoe to introduce herself.
- **Zoe, play [name of the song/video you want to watch on youtube]** - Quick way to open your wished song on YT (but not accurate).
- **Zoe, go to [name of the website you want Zoe to open]** - please say the website name with '.com' or with another domain name at the end. 
You can for example open YouTube with this command and Zoe will ask you for a song/video name and she will play that for you. It is a more accurate way than 'play' command. You can open any website you want with this command. You can also open Google.com and the assistant will ask you what you want to look for and she will open the first website she encounters.
  * **Play [name of the song/video]** - After opening YouTube.com with **Go to** command, she will ask you what to play. Use this command if you want her to do it all alone or...
  * **Nothing** - Use this one, if you want her to stop at that point!
- **Zoe, search [name of what you are searching for] wikipedia** - Zoe will look up in wikipedia what you are looking for, and read out the two first sentences from what she got.
- **Zoe, compute [for example "two plus two', distance beetween New York and Washington"]** - Zoe will try to compute what you are asking for.
- **Zoe, what time is it** - Zoe will read for you the current time.
- **Zoe, thank you** - don't forget to thank her from time to time!
- **Zoe, sleep** - Zoe will fall asleep until you wake her up with **Wake up** command.
- **Zoe, close** - Zoe will end the program.

### Zoe is under construction, and more features will be added!
